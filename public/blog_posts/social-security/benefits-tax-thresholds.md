## Overview

Social Security benefits for retirees are paid out from a trust fund called the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund. The U.S. didn't begin taxing distributions from the 50 year-old program until 1984 (Reagan) following the passage of the Social Security Amendments, which were signed into law to keep the program solvent. The revenue from these taxes goes right back into the trust fund. We face a similar challenge today, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting the fund will be depleted at the end of fiscal year 2033. At that point, beneficiaries would face a 25% reduction in benefits unless Congress acts to address the shortfall.

Confusingly, the Trump Administration has raised the idea of ending taxes on Social Security benefits.
